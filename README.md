# My Portfolio

## Description
This is a webpage I've created to showcase my web development and design projects and introduce myself to the coding community. The html and css files include comments explaining the features included. The links in the heading scroll to the About, Work, and Contact sections of the page for easy navigation. The project images included currently are placeholders and link to music and poetry I enjoy or things I like learning about. The contact links at the bottom are also placeholders and will take you to the sign in pages for social media sites. The layout will respond as the browser is resized or when the page is viewed on smaller screens to ensure legibility. 

##Usage
Click the page link provided to see my work! Open the html and css or inspect the page elements in the browser to see how the features were accomplished and notes on how they should work. Stay tuned for an updated portfolio as I work on bigger, better projects in the future!
